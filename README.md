# Mapping-and-Navigation-with-TurtleBot3

## Description
This project plans to implement SLAM using TurtleBot3 in Gazebo with turtlebot3_plaza model as an arena.

## Status
- Robot and other complementary models can be spawned into gazebo.
- SLAM is yet to be implemented.

## Approach
- Initially generated amp using gmapping package.
- Then implement localization using particle filter.(hardcoding and not using any package)
- then can try SLAM using pose graph optimization.(hardcoding and not using any package)
